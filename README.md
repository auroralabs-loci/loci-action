## LOCI GitHub Action


**Line of Code Insights (LOCI)** lets you upload compiled binaries for performance analysis, view insights directly in your workflow summary, and (if you install the GitHub App) automatically receive PR comments with results.

- `upload`: uploads binaries to the `LOCI` backend.
- `summary`: waits for the analysis to complete and attaches the agent report to the workflow run summary.
  
  Comments on PRs are posted automatically by the GitHub App after completed binaries upload.

### Quick start

> Before you begin:
> - Add `LOCI_BACKEND_URL` as a GitHub Variable.
> - Add `LOCI_API_KEY` as a GitHub Secret.
> - Install the LOCI `GitHub App` on your repo if you want automatic PR comments and overall Performance Reviews.
> - (optional, `agentic mode only`) If you want the summary step to add the summary report to the workflow job UI (note that the job will wait for the binaries upload and analysis to finish), add a Personal Access Token in a `LOCI_GITHUB_TOKEN` env variable for our action (we advice to store the actual token as a GitHub Secret).

### Example: Build + Upload

```yaml
name: LOCI Integration
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
  push:
    branches: [main]

env:
  LOCI_PROJECT: GHDemo

jobs:
  build-and-upload:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Prepare environment
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install -y gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu g++-aarch64-linux-gnu
        shell: bash

      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build sample
        run: |
          mkdir -p samples/build/bin
          aarch64-linux-gnu-g++ -o samples/build/bin/sample_01 samples/sample_01.cpp
        shell: bash

      - name: Upload Artifacts
        uses: auroralabs-loci/loci-action@v1.0.0
        env:
          LOCI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LOCI_API_KEY }}
          LOCI_BACKEND_URL: ${{ vars.LOCI_BACKEND_URL }}
        with:
          mode: upload
          project: ${{ env.LOCI_PROJECT }}
          binaries: samples/build/bin/
```

### Example: Build + Upload + Summary (adds report and insights to job UI)

```yaml
jobs:
  build-upload-and-summary:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # ... build steps ...

      - name: LOCI Upload
        uses: auroralabs-loci/loci-action@v1.0.0
        env:
          LOCI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LOCI_API_KEY }}
          LOCI_BACKEND_URL: ${{ vars.LOCI_BACKEND_URL }}
        with:
          mode: upload
          project: ${{ env.LOCI_PROJECT }}
          binaries: samples/build/bin/

      - name: LOCI Summary
        uses: auroralabs-loci/loci-action@v1.0.0
        env:
          LOCI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LOCI_API_KEY }}
          LOCI_BACKEND_URL: ${{ vars.LOCI_BACKEND_URL }}
          LOCI_GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.LOCI_GITHUB_TOKEN }} # required only for agent summary (if agentic mode is enabled)
        with:
          mode: summary
          project: ${{ env.LOCI_PROJECT }}
```

#### Good to know

- The upload step is enough for the GitHub App to add a comment on the PR (if installed and company has agentic mode enabled).
- The summary step is only needed if you want the workflow run summary to show the LOCI report and top function insights.

### How it works

- Upload step → always required; uploads binaries to LOCI backend.
- Summary step →
  - Standard mode → adds top-n Function Insights only.
  - Agentic mode → adds Agent Summary Report + Function Insights.
- GitHub App installed →
  - Posts Agent Summary Report as a PR comment (Agentic only).
  - Enables Performance Review Check Run (pass/fail).
